Introduction
============

Seele blockchain is based on the Neural Consensus protocol, which
consists of a mainchain and subchains to form a heterogeneous forest
multi-chain ecosystem when fully developed. https://seele.pro

The current mainnet release: Seele mainchain is powered by a new
memory-consuming consensus PoW algorithm, which records intermediate
hash strings. `SPOW

The mainchain has four shards. It can perform transactions within a
shard or crossing shards. However, smart contracts currently can be only
executed within the same shard. Seele subchains are under development.
The so called EDA consensus algorithm `EDA

from Seele will be utilized for the subchains.
